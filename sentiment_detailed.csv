2022-12-08 21:12:13+00:00,catalysts for bitcoin so from what ive gathered theres multiple catalysts for bitcoin price next year despite a looming recessionwhich is a fact at this point first one is the halveningobvious by the end of there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long upward trend towards a minimum of k per bitcoin according to models that have a historical price accuracy of bitcoins value should peak at around m per bitcoin in average recession lasts for around months so by the time this one will be over bitcoins price should be around k at the end of next yearbeginning of second one is the gaapaccounting standard next year this law will be improved so that companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value currently if the price goes down in value but jumps back up again companies have to write down the value of the digital asset and cant mark it up starting from next year it will be different which apparently has been a dealbreaker for institutional investors in the past third one is the capital inflow of traditional investors like investment banks pension funds central banks smallbig countries and different funds currently holding digital assets in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulationtransparencypublic disclosings from the beginning of next yearjanuary the united states congress will be having a session where the sec and congress will both fight over which entity gets to set the rules they both seem to be in a hurry to be the first ones which is a positive for crypto investors as the institutions feel safer to invest the capital inflow should be somewhere around trillion usd for the price to reach k at the end of next year current price would have to quadruple so approximately trillion usd would be sufficient total amount of assets held by mutual funds in the us is trillion usd germany has trillion and uk brazil and switzerland collectively own trillion usd thats close to trillion if of this would go to bitcoin its price would quadruple another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effectx of investing in the stock market in which only billion of capital inflow from institutional investors would be necessary to reach a trillion market cap x billion usd trillion i included switzerland because its central bank has said its interested in acquiring bitcoin theres a few other potential catalysts in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positive in the coming year big countries like iranrussia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and the pilot of cbdcs also ukraine is one of the largest bitcoin holders so there are multiple concrete things to look forward to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession the biggest factors for a long bear phase are imo rising oil prices and interest rates until the end of next year in addition to that revolving and nonrevolving credits are at an all time high while the savings rate of americans is at an all time low if the recession will last around months it should be a relatively sound timing for the price to shoot up to k per bitcoin during the third picture is metcalfs law which predicts the value to be minimum k by its not as delicious as the other two models but still decent considering the fact that it would be the minimum value according to this model the value would be minimum m usd during and hover above m until it reaches during next decade these are just some thoughts things ive gathered hope someone finds it useful cheers,reddit_comments,neutral,0.7823872566223145,0.0,0.0

2022-12-11 17:13:06+00:00,lntip this post is for those who have been tipped maybe the tipper linked this post to help you or you want to learn more about lntips on the bitcoin sub rlntipbot for more official information non wallet use you can start right now without set up you just need someone to tip you i recently discovered there is a tip bot that you can use in the bitcoin sub and i think others the great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning wallet and then withdraw your tips or use your own lightning wallet to add sats to your personal tip jar you dont need to if someone tips you sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in sats to it thats the minimum tip then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else no need to even set up a wallet you can use sats all you want just from your own tips get them and pass them on side note you can send private messages to the bot and it will give your balance or a code to send sats to or receive sats via lightning wallet just using the links on the bot reply to tip type lntip or any number higher than it will tip the person you are replying to if you dont have the funds available in your account for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning wallet use with a wallet setting up a lightning wallet and adding sats to the bot a great guide from doublelr tip him if he posts in comments i use muun too so you are in luck it works a very small bit different than you think i am on a phone so this is what i just did to transfer sat from the tipbot balance to my muun wallet very easy youll see prior to doing this you must have the wallet fully set up get your seed phrase words aka your keys and write them down and keep them safe then do the rescueemergency pdf thing too its pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out after that open muun and select receive at the top there are two option buttons select lightning and the screen will change to a lightning address at the bottom you will see invoice settings select that and you will see a button to add an amount and an expiry time for the invoice press add and enter the amount you want to withdraw from the tipbot balance press confirm and the invoice will change again to the address that represents what you just created an invoice for the amount of sats you entered press copy and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your phone open reddit and find a tipbot message it has the blue links in it you see it every time a tip is given press withdraw and it will create the dm format for you once you learn the format very simple you can create it from scratch like a normal dm but the blue link does this for you until you learn the format well enough to create it on your own on the dm page created by the blue link there is a spot that says put_invoice_here delete only that simple phrase and then paste in to the same spot and your invoice you copied earlier will appear the line that says withdraw needs to stay where it is press send open muun as fast as you can and see if you can beat the withdrawal to your wallet from reddit enjoy fellow redditor it seems like a lot but im reality steps will become step for you and steps will also become one step for you so once you learn it its basically two steps lightning is badass enjoy fellow redditor general help some useful faq type information not included on the bot website if you are clueless then hopefully this list will give you enough information to start to google the gaps in your knowledge what is bitcoin its a digital commodity like gold but much easier to transport what are sats each bitcoin is made of a million sats like dollars and cents but with lots more sats per bitcoin to make payments easier what is lightning the bitcoin nextwork is slow and super secure great for transfer of large amounts of money but not good for tips and coffee so clever people built a second layer on top and that is the lighting network it allows you to send sats super fast and cheap what is a bot an automated service to help you dont worry about sending messages to it as long as you dont change the words its just like sending a command to a computer and it will return your answer privately do i need a wallet perhaps not you can be given tips and then check your balance here on reddit and only tip others using your tips a great little circular community but then i do need a wallet yes when you either have so many tips on your reddit ln bot account wallet that you want to withdraw them fully or use them in the real world then you will need a wallet or if you have no tips and want to tip then you will need a wallet whats a reddit ln bot account wallet the clever people who made this tip bot made it so you automatically get a little wallet just for use with the bot only attached to your username that the bot can use to track your tips and balances smart whats a lightning wallet a lightning wallet probably an app that you can install the app allows transfer of bitcoinsats to any other wallets great for buying stuff in locations that accept bitcoin sending bitcoin or sats to your friends l and for sending sats to fill your tip account where do i get a lightning wallet when youre ready to use one google it and find one you like anything else to know only one last bit if you tip more than you have availabille or you try to make a deposit clicking and sending deposit as a message to the bot then the clever bot will give you a long number code that you can copy and enter into your lightning wallet app to make a payment when you do you will have used bitcoin and passed a tip to someone else how nice of you the code side of

2022-12-13 22:26:00+00:00,understanding wallet imports from bitcoin hotwallets hey everyone im fairly new to how bitcoin works and with everything thats happened recently its no surprise im in the same boat as a ton of people withdrawing from exchanges but im trying to understand more of bitcoin works under the hood as i find the tech fascinating i withdrew all my funds from ftx thankfully on time and more recently binance and chose trust wallet as i found their multicoin wallet from a single mnemonic an interesting idea and the app looks and functions great the only downside is that theres no way to access some of my wallets from the extension so i went with electrum to get my bitcoin address on my computer heres where my big confusion lies when i imported my wallet from the mnemonic i got a bunch of wallets the first one being the one trust wallet gives me i assume thats how hd wallets work however when converting my bip mnemonic to a bip seed importing that seed in electrum still works but i get completely different addresses is there any logical explanation to this a friend of mine suggested maybe electrum does something to the seed but that possibly cant be the case id hope as a side question somewhat unrelated but im also wondering when i created a wallet on trust it gave me the mnemonic as it should maybe im too skeptical but how is trust supposed to know it cant give the same mnemonic to someone else how is it made sure that no other user from any other software hot wallet app will ever get the same mnemonic as me thank you for your time to anyone that can help me understand those xb ps i know i will get scammers and whatnot in dms i wont reply to anyone in dms so no need to tell me in the comments if that can spare you some writing im also aware i showed my balance in the screenshot its there to show that the left window imported from the mnemonic does contain the wallet trust gave me and that the right window imported from the seed does not thank you again,reddit_comments,neutral,0.6971023678779602,0.0,0.0

2022-12-14 09:37:41+00:00,trusting bitcoin services and businesses bitcoin is all about understanding and managing your own risk and trust be that the decision to run a node or not use a light wallet or not a company nodewallet or not you also have to decide who you will give your business to and what risk youre willing to expose yourself to when engaging with bitcoin services with that in mind lets conceptualize a few different kinds of bitcoin services so we know to look out for them and can make educated choices as consumers the low trust service this is a bitcoin service delivered in a low trust manner where the bitcoin user need only utilize software they run and control for the services and can protect themselves from malicious third parties with very little trust or consequence from peers this is the gold standard of bitcoin service examples include lightning routing lightning liquidity marketplaces like pool coinjoins like joinmarket coinswaps submarine swaps like loop and others when at all possible this is the kind of service you want to run many services and contracts in bitcoin or layers will claim to be low trust even decentralized which isnt all necessary for a business they are supposed to be centralized but very few are ask yourself what recourse you alone have against fraud and what fraud would be possible for example in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by watching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transactions you can broadcast at will you have responsibility watch the blockchain and recourse publish transactions proving fraud and claim balance the risks revolve around your own capacity time delays locking up your coins and other general inconveniences not impacting your custody trust the service will be provided this is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and have little to no recourse if the service is not provided pretty normal youre risking whatever youre spending in a transaction examples include every merchant business accepting bitcoin the merchants using btcpay server and noncustodial exchanges like bullbitcoin this is also a very good model with limited risk but often little recourse the federated trust service this is a bitcoin service which spreads responsibility across a number of actors for success or failure its not nearly as good as trusting yourself and relies on third parties to protect your interests examples include liquid rsk peg multisig custodians bisq escrow these services often delve into shitcoins and when they do should be avoided like any other the risk in these cases is often not exceptionally limited include custody and your recourse relies on third parties if any exists at all the first party custodian this bitcoin service relies on only itself it often prides itself on this self reliance boasting a lack of third parties and self custody river financial is a good example if you can trust the one business these can be quality services they can also be horrible rug pulling scams the risks in these custodians are similar to a federated service but only trusting one party as with all custodians at and below this point the correct answer is dont use a custodian the rd party custodian this is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian like prime trust examples include strike and swan among many others while both are bitcoin only companies the custodian they rely on holds over shitcoins these kinds of services can be dangerous because they can appear to be very bold bitcoin only companies but on closer inspection you will find they dont self custody a central tenant of a good bitcoin participant in the space user and business alike this can expose users to all kinds of risks and broadens the number of actors exposing users to risk even if its not just custody for example kraken just leaked user data via a zendesk leak this is why evaluating who you are trusting is important and i make these specific examples to illustrate why you cant take even well respected community members at their word you need to evaluate for yourself are you trusting them or a tower of service providers other examples on the more severely negative end of this description include lending platforms like blockfi and celcius where the tower of third party dependency extends through custodianship and lending and other abusive business models these businesses can run the gamut from moderately acceptable to horrible run for your life depending largely on the complexity of the tower of rd party dependency and the severity of risk each party exposes you to the shitcoin casino this isnt a bitcoin service at all its a public harm these are exchanges which service and host scams exposing their users to the custodial risks of their shittiest shitcoin they often print their own shitcoins they lure users in with toogoodtobetrue fees they should be avoided at all cost examples include ftx coinbase binance kraken gemini kucoin and many many others most others i wont be linking them because you shouldnt use them tldr as you evaluate what kind of businesses and services you want to use what risks youre willing to expose yourself and your coins to and hopefully even what kind of businesses you want to encourage in this space consider all your options not every service has

2022-12-15 00:06:40+00:00,help me believe in blockchain technology again lately i have been having a bit of an existential crisis with the true utility of the blockchain i was initially drawn in by the digital goldrush but like many i stayed because i really believed in the future of crypto as this bear market has progressed i have been filtering through the junk as i dive deeper into crypto and blockchain technology i am starting to see less how the blockchain has real utility here are a couple of my opinions i would love if somebody with more knowledge of the space could refute anything i say with evidence possibly cryptos greatest strength is the decentralized network and ability to process instantaneous transactions this is especially useful for large payments and international transactions the problem is there no easy way to convert bitcoin to fiat without using a centralized exchange the argument would be that eventually we could use bitcoin or other tokens as transactional currency but we are still far from there needing to rely on exchanges to convert bitcoin to fiat comes with many of the problems that come with transferring money to begin with at the end of the day unless you are transferring crypto from one wallet to another and the receiving party plans on just holding the crypto it offers very little improvement to wire transfers the second issue i have is with linking tokens or nfts to physical goods despite the blockchain being a brilliant and secure way of tracing transactions since there is no way to link a real physical world item to the blockchain it makes tracing items impossible i often hear about using blockchain in regard to the supply chain assuming a qr code is used to track certain items the qr code can always be removed or recreated it would also rely on always scanning the qr code to track it if the code is not scanned then the transaction will never show up in the case of digital items like nft art it costs so much energy to upload medidata on chain that it is not feasible most nfts rely on medidata servers to store the nft which makes the whole point of having a blochian pointless to begin with you cant hide the medidata for confidential documents you dont own the copyright to the nft in a legal sense and you cant prevent anybody from copying the medidata you own on the blockchain this leads to the last point which is most if not all crypto projects are creating solutions to problems they invented aside from the obvious pump and dumps even legitimate projects do not offer real world value it seems like so much of crypto relies on the narrative that we will be socializing transacting and living more in the digital world most projects assume one day their project will be useful while that may be the case it seems like we are still far from living in a ready player style world i dont know of any projects except bitocin that that solve a problem that exists today and solves the problem in a way no other technology could to summarize it seems like crypto is a cool technology that has very little practical use in todays world i still love the crypto world and i want to believe in it but i am seeing less and less a true use for it as i take off the goggles and try to look at everything from a practical and productive point of view the argument for crypto is becoming less and less clear to me please educate me on what i am missing because i know i really am looking to learn,reddit_comments,neutral,0.4796661138534546,0.0,0.0

2022-12-17 13:15:40+00:00,read and decide do we want to be sheep or do we truly want to evolve and better ourselves the global economy has been under a monetary policy for the past years that has empowered central banks and puppet governments to get richer while retail individuals and businesses have become poorer and more ignorant of the suppression of this global power these central banks and governments manipulate the exchange rate for their own benefit rather than helping the people if you are not familiar with how central banks and governments operate it is worth doing some research a simple google search for fractional reserve system will reveal that if a bank has it can lend out at a specific payback rate of x depending on the bank we believe that central banks and governments control everything because we the sheep dont look into these things their jargon is too difficult for us to understand so we just think that we dont understand but if we are capable of running our own businesses shops barbershops bakeries lettings agencies gas stations farms and producing more wealth than governments and banks why do they control the middle man who does the transactions and says they are legitimate before we did not have a system that could legitimately take control away from the middle man and his ability to make the rules of money or dictate the value of the currency we use but now with the emergence of bitcoin we have a system where a value can be achieved and cannot be changed satoshi will always be worth satoshi at the time of writing bitcoin is worth approximately in fiat currency this means that with in this bitcoin economy you would have satoshi lets say we use a ratio and as a farmer you charge or satoshi for one egg plus a network fee of satoshi which would not be necessary if we did not use the exchange rate dictated by governments and banks if all energy suppliers adopted this ratio then food suppliers could do the same and use this system instead of relying on the fractional reserve system where they have an unfair advantage at a ratio of without actually producing anything thereby devaluing the actual currency as a producer which would you prefer being paid the same amount for your goods and services today tomorrow and in years or giving banks the power to dictate that you must pay more to produce and charge more for your products just because the middle man wants to take a share the adoption of bitcoin gives individuals and businesses the potential to take back control of their financial transactions and reduce their reliance on traditional financial institutions however its important to be aware of the risks and challenges associated with using other types of cryptocurencys if all aged people understood how the economic system works and how bitcoin works they might choose freedom over a fiat asset that is essentially worthless fiat money which is issued and controlled by governments has value only because people agree to accept it as payment for goods and services but we have no control over the supply of fiat money and governments can print more of it at will which makes it cheaper on the other hand bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network where transactions are verified by a network of nodes and miners in order to make any changes or improvements to the network these nodes and miners must reach a consensus of at least this means that anyone who runs a node has a say in any changes or improvements to the network in contrast traditional banks are opaque and have no accountability to the public we have no idea how much money they have and they can continue to print more even if they are on the verge of bankruptcy the current economic system based on fiat money and controlled by a few powerful banks and governments is flawed and ultimately leads to homelessness and hunger for many people the value of money is constantly decreasing and today might only buy half of what it did even two years ago by adopting a decentralized system like bitcoin we can empower ourselves and take back control making our own decisions about what our time and effort is worth instead of blindly accepting the value that the current system assigns to fiat money we can use a true system where everyone can see and validate the worth of their contributions its time to stop thinking like sheep and start taking charge of our own economic destiny could we not be capable as retail to produce and service ourselves using the network big whales they could easily buy out power companys and start delivering energy and get paid in satoshi price the energy in satoshi and use excess energy for mining or securing the network the same with farms a bitcoin whale could buy out and teach farmers what bitcoin is and how it can benefit them we have to engage producers or make ourselves producers and make our own bitcoin standard and prices with todays tech and possibilities could we not set our own retail chains from producers to client and leverage the network to our freedom if any one is a producer and if we can get producers from all types of industries in this talk and

2022-12-19 01:26:32+00:00,comment ive been on a long bitcoincrypto learning journey i even work for a crypto company my conclusion when factoring in where we are within the larger financial macro climate is this bitcoin is a niche its a token for those that believe in being able to disconnect and opt out of the central governmental system its a great way to hide wealth from significant others in the case of divorces you can say you lost your seed phrase too awesome of course your address if known could be monitored to see if you move your bitcoin but thats unlikely for most small net worth divorces you can send money around the world super easy move money across boarders super easy with bitcoin all good however we all live on land in countries and towns and cities that are all operating within the rule and law of central governmental systems in your average day of living in a home commuting to work buying groceries using utilities earning a wage paying tax you are not able to opt out the system the only way would be to buy some remote island and survive all by yourself ed stafford style to get bitcoins the majority of us exchange our fiat to use bitcoins in most of every day life scenarios we have to exchange back to fiat so then its a inflation hedge but its ability to beat inflation is based solely on the price that people are exchanging it to fiat for so then it starts to enter ponzi territory in that you hope the person after you bought it is going to pay more for it when you sell it i dont see how and why central governments would hand over control to a trustless currency to peg their too no government would hand over such control so i just dont see it going to mass adoption or m value per coin territory i see it just being a niche like esperanto language and thats not because im against it i was paid in bitcoin for awhile it would be awesome if we got to m per coin but i just dont see it limited supply people like saylor and other whales gobbling it up manipulating it etc why would you want something of limited supply that some guy over there has absolutely loads of it lets see if you have spare cash and absolutely zero idea what to do with it and have a cold wallet etc ok but as with ftx for the average person which exchange you gonna trust the on ramps now all look like scams and the whole uiux of wallets and addresses its kinda techy you need to be computer literate and those long addresses i double check it multiple times but such a pain and any error as many have found and your moneys gone sent to wrong address etc so for mass adoption its just been set back massively and still isnt as easy to use as an apple pay like product and pretty much every other crypto after bitcoin is absolutely hot air scam based on absolutely nothing just printed out of thin air nonsense would not touch any of it pure speculation at the mercy of those that created the tokens,reddit_comments,positive,0.5571355819702148,1.0,0.5571355819702148

2022-12-19 06:35:23+00:00,comment click here to listen to a few minutes of bitcoin developer jimmy song talk about ethereum and vitalik jimmy worked directly with vitalik from the beginning back when vitalik was still working on rootstock for bitcoin ethereum is a centralized scam that totally revolutionized scams and is the future of pyramid schemes how many erc pyramid scamcoins run on top of ethereum again but it would still be a centralized scam even if it was created without the massive premine ethereum started with a million eth premine but that doesnt mean people cant make money with it a lot of people even made money with bitconnect dogecoin and shiba inu lol so as long as suckers keep buying it then it can keep going up institutional investors have no interest in it and this report details why it even explains that when the fees get too high and things dont go as planned users will and are switch to a different cryptocurrency you can already see this happening right now with all of the eth killers over of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over of them have no future none of them are as secure as decentralized or launched as fairly as bitcoin satoshi created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else bitcoin had no premine no developer fund no developer tax and no leader satoshi never sold made no profit got no fame for his real identity removed himself from the project and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched bitcoin bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol and it has no leader or company leading it cryptocurrency is full of scammersgrifters ignorance and people that actually believe the lies because theyve been sucked into shitcoin cults people use altcoins for tradinggambling to increase their bitcoin stack or even their ethereum stack if they dont understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose bitcoin when gambling on altcoins satoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that bitcoin was launched fairly no premine satoshi didnt grant himself any coins gave a month heads up before launching the network no sudden release and no mining before release coins had no value for years so they circulated freely its not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this satoshi never cashed out unlike every altcoin founder in history and i bet it stays that way for eternity ethereum launched with million eth for the developers and million eth for sale as an initial coin offering they purposely misled investors by suggesting merely million gifted premine and ignoring the million that they sold misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus this is a serious concern in light of ripple getting sued by the sec as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after ethereum developers and the ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security because thats what it is according to the howey test just a few days ago the chair of the sec gary gensler even said that several cryptocurrencies are actually noncompliant seucurities and ethereum is one the two cryptocurrencies that the sec is first focusing on even though etherians always say that the sec said its not a security but theyve really already disregarded that previous claim made by bill hinman former director of the secs division of corporation finance who suggested that offers and sales of eth are not securities transactions gary gensler the current chair of the sec has now said that a lot of crypto tokens i wont call them cryptocurrencies for this moment are indeed noncompliant securities vitalik and many others in the ethereum space are known scammers vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of eth now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but rich statefulness gregory maxwell vitalik buterin ran a quantum computer scam quantum computing and bitcoin with vitalik buterin vitaliks quantum scam the ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots trying to find narrative fit and the ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit theyve literally tried world computer dapps crowdfunding nfts defi open finance radical markets store of value and more ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency but there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution what purpose does ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems they also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks unlike ethereum bitcoins inflation distribution rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change the inflation distribution rate and final algo of ethereum is not even defined and people are investing in this this is insane and it basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team while at the same time newbies are misled into believing that ethereum is decentralized meanwhile vitalik has full control over the whole project do you even remember the dao contract someone found a way to drain eth and some of vitaliks buddies lost a ton of eth so he rolled back the entire blockchain because ethereum is centralized vitalik is the leader of it and everyone in the ethereum community agrees with him and he can do whatever he wants he chose to change the name of the real ethereum blockchain to ethereum classic and calls his rolled back blockchain ethereum not long ago eth miners said they werent going to follow vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn so vitalik leader of ethereum called their consensus a attack and changed the rules vitalik can only control ethereum because its centralized the fact that ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your eth being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations exchanges for example must send a misc to the irs on behalf of any american user earning in a year proofofstake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and i have no expectation that the new ethereum will be any more successful than the current one this can only be done because ethereum is centralized ethereum will still be a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers vitalik is already laying the groundwork for some more hype and suggesting a rebrand to ethereum ethereum scam part here we focus on the ethereum token presale which to anyone with any financial experience is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security ethereum scam part here we take a look at the value business proposition of decentralized smart contracts and why its one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient ethereum scam part the ethereum scam part ethereum and ethereum classic are scams and so are the developers that build on them addendum here is is an actual clip of joseph lubin describing how they allowed whales to use multiple fake identities to buy as much eth as they wanted during the ethereum presale a person can buy with any number of different identities we may limit the unit size of a single sale to make it easier to disguise so that nobody scares people with an enormous initial purchase if you are a whale and you plan on investing several million us dollars worth then you can do so with with multiple identities joseph lubin is the founder and ceo of consensys and a cofounder of ethereum the goal is to lure people in and switch to proof of stake and rule,reddit_comments,neutral,0.9035448431968689,0.0,0.0
