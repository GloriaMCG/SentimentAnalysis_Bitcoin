2022-12-18 17:58:44,Reddit,assuming bitcoin will need a smaller unit than sats eventually how does that look from a technical point of view due to bitcoins hard cap if bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency and all things become naturally priced in bitcoin this would mean that each bitcoin and each sat will become more and more valuable as the economy grows i know assuming the economy will grow indefinitely is not as trivial as im making it sound but lets just assume itll be the case for this thought experiment so basically things will cost less and less bitcoin and we will reach a point when a single gummy bear will be worth less than sat at this point well need a smaller unit in order to pay for everyday stuff even a cup of coffee will be worth less than sat eventually hell you could say that about almost anything if you go far enough in the future assuming the human race survives till the universe ends so my questions are whats the code change needed to make this a reality is it just changing some value on a line of code in github and then of course the majority of the nodes accepting the change if so where is that line why wasnt bitcoin made infinitely divisible in the first place are there some technical issues that would arise if this was the case whats the reasoning behind choosing million per bitcoin as the lower limit and not million or billion,0,41

2022-12-18 03:17:17,Reddit,question concerning solvency of bitcoin ok basic question here to my knowledge btc requires miners to validate transactions proof of work and mining requires an expenditure of energy which costs generally some kind of fiat currency as bitcoin halves and becomes harder to mine the relative profit margin approaches the cost of mining further fluctuations in the value of btc potentially means putting miners underwater versus the cost of mining electricityhardware what happens when the cost of mining outstrips the profit of btc say the cost of mining one btc is btcs in the relative fiat currency if miners drop out and transactions cannot be validated the relative exchange value of btc is thus since no exchange can take place is there something im missing here this seems like a weakness inherent to pow crypto especially btc which has a growing cost to mine based upon the halving aspect of the hash mining further i cannot think of a real world counterpart since exchanging gold isnt incumbent on anyone mining it in fact as gold miners drop out the cost of gold would increase due to the effect of scarcity im sure im missing something since this seems like an obvious real threat to crypto as an investment vehicle at least proof of work models that rely on mining to validate exchangestransactions,1,20

2022-12-18 00:12:15,Reddit,explain to me why bitcoin holds any value i cant wrap my mind around it it seems like the only thing giving bitcoin any tangible real world value is simply the electricity that goes into mining a coin how does a coin have value if i cant use it at the grocery store i cant buy gas for my car with it i cant really use it for well much at all except buying sketchy drugs on the internet what is a true valuation for something like bitcoin wheres the floor for something so obviously overvalued right now is k even too high for something that derives almost all its value from speculative investment is it even decentralized anymore i mean its practically as regulated as any security these days and theyre talking about regulating it even more you can track pp transactions easily and the fbi has shown exceeding competency at such tracking in multiple legal cases against bitcoin holders and users tldr why bitcoin instead of fiat and what is a true valutation for bitcoin inb a million down doots from people who dont wanna discuss this edit well this went painfully expectedly of the replies are just hurr the dollar bad tho and but its private i was really hoping to get some insight as someone who understands and was around when bitcoin started but cant seem to wrap my head around anything over the double digits for a valuation the intrinsic problem with bitcoin is it relies on banks and the fiat to work what do you do when you sell bitcoin for idk if it manages to even hold k for the rest of the year you sold it for dollars so you could use it you take the bitcoin move it from your wallet to an exchange aka a middle man yes theres definitely a middle man and they charge you fees out the ass and you sell it for fiat currency because you need dollars to make it usable in any real world scenario ffs i cant,0,221

2022-12-17 16:53:39,Reddit,feeling grateful for bitcoin hey everyone i just wanted to share my thoughts on bitcoin with the community as a fairly new bitcoiner myself i am constantly amazed by the resilience and strength of this revolutionary digital asset one thing that really stands out to me is the decentralized nature of bitcoin unlike traditional financial systems that are controlled by a small group of individuals or institutions bitcoin is powered by a global network of nodes that work together to secure the blockchain this decentralization ensures that no single entity has control over the network making it resistant to censorship and corruption another aspect of bitcoin that i find particularly impressive is its ability to act as a store of value while the price of bitcoin can fluctuate in the short term its value has consistently increased over time making it a reliable investment for the long haul but perhaps what i love most about bitcoin is its potential to bring financial freedom to people around the world in countries with unstable currencies or oppressive governments bitcoin provides a way for individuals to take control of their own wealth and financial future overall i am bullish on bitcoin and cant wait to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology what about you guys why do you love bitcoin,13,14

2022-12-17 13:15:40,Reddit,read and decide do we want to be sheep or do we truly want to evolve and better ourselves the global economy has been under a monetary policy for the past years that has empowered central banks and puppet governments to get richer while retail individuals and businesses have become poorer and more ignorant of the suppression of this global power these central banks and governments manipulate the exchange rate for their own benefit rather than helping the people if you are not familiar with how central banks and governments operate it is worth doing some research a simple google search for fractional reserve system will reveal that if a bank has it can lend out at a specific payback rate of x depending on the bank we believe that central banks and governments control everything because we the sheep dont look into these things their jargon is too difficult for us to understand so we just think that we dont understand but if we are capable of running our own businesses shops barbershops bakeries lettings agencies gas stations farms and producing more wealth than governments and banks why do they control the middle man who does the transactions and says they are legitimate before we did not have a system that could legitimately take control away from the middle man and his ability to make the rules of money or dictate the value of the currency we use but now with the emergence of bitcoin we have a system where a value can be achieved and cannot be changed satoshi will always be worth satoshi at the time of writing bitcoin is worth approximately in fiat currency this means that with in this bitcoin economy you would have satoshi lets say we use a ratio and as a farmer you charge or satoshi for one egg plus a network fee of satoshi which would not be necessary if we did not use the exchange rate dictated by governments and banks if all energy suppliers adopted this ratio then food suppliers could do the same and use this system instead of relying on the fractional reserve system where they have an unfair advantage at a ratio of without actually producing anything thereby devaluing the actual currency as a producer which would you prefer being paid the same amount for your goods and services today tomorrow and in years or giving banks the power to dictate that you must pay more to produce and charge more for your products just because the middle man wants to take a share the adoption of bitcoin gives individuals and businesses the potential to take back control of their financial transactions and reduce their reliance on traditional financial institutions however its important to be aware of the risks and challenges associated with using other types of cryptocurencys if all aged people understood how the economic system works and how bitcoin works they might choose freedom over a fiat asset that is essentially worthless fiat money which is issued and controlled by governments has value only because people agree to accept it as payment for goods and services but we have no control over the supply of fiat money and governments can print more of it at will which makes it cheaper on the other hand bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network where transactions are verified by a network of nodes and miners in order to make any changes or improvements to the network these nodes and miners must reach a consensus of at least this means that anyone who runs a node has a say in any changes or improvements to the network in contrast traditional banks are opaque and have no accountability to the public we have no idea how much money they have and they can continue to print more even if they are on the verge of bankruptcy the current economic system based on fiat money and controlled by a few powerful banks and governments is flawed and ultimately leads to homelessness and hunger for many people the value of money is constantly decreasing and today might only buy half of what it did even two years ago by adopting a decentralized system like bitcoin we can empower ourselves and take back control making our own decisions about what our time and effort is worth instead of blindly accepting the value that the current system assigns to fiat money we can use a true system where everyone can see and validate the worth of their contributions its time to stop thinking like sheep and start taking charge of our own economic destiny could we not be capable as retail to produce and service ourselves using the network big whales they could easily buy out power companys and start delivering energy and get paid in satoshi price the energy in satoshi and use excess energy for mining or securing the network the same with farms a bitcoin whale could buy out and teach farmers what bitcoin is and how it can benefit them we have to engage producers or make ourselves producers and make our own bitcoin standard and prices with todays tech and possibilities could we not set our own retail chains from producers to client and leverage the network to our freedom if any one is a producer and if we can get producers from all types of industries in this talk and please feel free to do so we can truly make a better world of we put our efforts to it,1,8

2022-12-16 01:14:26,Reddit,replay attacks on blockchains one of the easiest attack possible on all blockchains is the replay attackit basically takes advantages of hardforks to use a valid transaction from one of the chain and broadcast it to anotherlets take an examplewe create an hardfork called bwef bitcoin wef of course our shitcoin will be shorted on market and nobody will supports it but like ethw people will know they can sell it and get fee money you have btc so you received bwef trading each for k for free lets dump it quick so you wanna swap you bwef on a website for free money houray in order to do this you have to send your bwef by creating a transaction and signing ityou then sell and get your dollars so you got your k for a shitcoin you didnt want anyway thats just a win right but here is the issue your transaction is public and is also valid on real btc chain so now an attacker can broadcast this same transaction on original chain this could be the buyer of your bwefnow the buyer as received your bwef and your real btc youre sold your btc for k so now lets talk about how to protect from this afaik there is no way to protect from what i just describe the only thing we can do is to avoid interacting with forked chains which can be difficult because most people dont use their own node so when signing and broadcasting a transaction they may be sending it to a node of the forked chainso if someone knows more about this and would like to correct me share infos like how to protect or anything please doi think this would help greatly community,1,24

2022-12-16 00:07:04,Reddit,difference between cold storage and no storage this is probably a dumb question but if you move bitcoin to a cold storage wallet then i understand that it is not on your computer anymore and that this is more secure as you cant get hacked unless somebody gets the cold storage drive and knows how to get in but if you move bitcoin to say an electrum wallet and save the seed phrase on paper somewhere or in your head and then you delete the electrum app completely from your computer then also you would not be able to get hacked via your computer if somebody gained access to it so what really is the difference or proscons of the approaches is there anything wrong with just deleting the wallet app and not spending extra money on a cold storage device since you can always recover the wallet with the seed whenever you want access to the bitcoin by reinstalling the wallet software,5,22

2022-12-15 03:52:43,Reddit,tired of binance begging me to return its been more than a year without using binance since i got all out of exchanges yall should see how concerned is binance emailing and texting me from sms asking me to return fast and grab the gifts they have for me otherwise my account will be deactivated more than emails daily since more than two months begging me to return to binance and verify my account guess what i didnt verify it i didnt care about getting my account deactivated and they still send me emails and sms telling the same every other day like i only can do withdrawals now or come back fast and grab this gift from us or verify your account and blahblahblah i really dont care about my binance account i have nothing of interest on it and i will not delete it because in order to do that i have to log in again and verify my account which ive already done two years ago they look almost desperated and if i was an actual user definitely i wouldnt trust that behaviour from a bussines or platform where my money is at im aware if binance goes bankruptcy could be the beginning of the end to crypto but you know what f binance f chenpeng zhao or however its written and f all exchanges while we are here for our own risk and profit they just want our money increasing the risk to us but none of them risk absolutely nothing from themselves they want our money so they can play their games without losing anything more than our trust it worked good for them while nobody realized theyre like undercover traditional banks so get everything out the exchanges and put it under your own hands im starting to think in order for crypto to win and for us to win with crypto intermediaries need to lose and disappear wasnt that the reason why bitcoin was created for ill give you another reason to boicot exchanges people create shitcoins trying to get rich instead of investing on whats really profitable but they keep creating shitcoins because they know the exchanges will support those cryptos and people will be able to buy them otherwise they wouldnt lose time creating something people couldnt buy or couldnt be interested in,5,6

2022-12-15 00:06:40,Reddit,help me believe in blockchain technology again lately i have been having a bit of an existential crisis with the true utility of the blockchain i was initially drawn in by the digital goldrush but like many i stayed because i really believed in the future of crypto as this bear market has progressed i have been filtering through the junk as i dive deeper into crypto and blockchain technology i am starting to see less how the blockchain has real utility here are a couple of my opinions i would love if somebody with more knowledge of the space could refute anything i say with evidence possibly cryptos greatest strength is the decentralized network and ability to process instantaneous transactions this is especially useful for large payments and international transactions the problem is there no easy way to convert bitcoin to fiat without using a centralized exchange the argument would be that eventually we could use bitcoin or other tokens as transactional currency but we are still far from there needing to rely on exchanges to convert bitcoin to fiat comes with many of the problems that come with transferring money to begin with at the end of the day unless you are transferring crypto from one wallet to another and the receiving party plans on just holding the crypto it offers very little improvement to wire transfers the second issue i have is with linking tokens or nfts to physical goods despite the blockchain being a brilliant and secure way of tracing transactions since there is no way to link a real physical world item to the blockchain it makes tracing items impossible i often hear about using blockchain in regard to the supply chain assuming a qr code is used to track certain items the qr code can always be removed or recreated it would also rely on always scanning the qr code to track it if the code is not scanned then the transaction will never show up in the case of digital items like nft art it costs so much energy to upload medidata on chain that it is not feasible most nfts rely on medidata servers to store the nft which makes the whole point of having a blochian pointless to begin with you cant hide the medidata for confidential documents you dont own the copyright to the nft in a legal sense and you cant prevent anybody from copying the medidata you own on the blockchain this leads to the last point which is most if not all crypto projects are creating solutions to problems they invented aside from the obvious pump and dumps even legitimate projects do not offer real world value it seems like so much of crypto relies on the narrative that we will be socializing transacting and living more in the digital world most projects assume one day their project will be useful while that may be the case it seems like we are still far from living in a ready player style world i dont know of any projects except bitocin that that solve a problem that exists today and solves the problem in a way no other technology could to summarize it seems like crypto is a cool technology that has very little practical use in todays world i still love the crypto world and i want to believe in it but i am seeing less and less a true use for it as i take off the goggles and try to look at everything from a practical and productive point of view the argument for crypto is becoming less and less clear to me please educate me on what i am missing because i know i really am looking to learn,1,21

or not a company nodewallet or not you also have to decide who you will give your business to and what risk youre willing to expose yourself to when engaging with bitcoin services with that in mind lets conceptualize a few different kinds of bitcoin services so we know to look out for them and can make educated choices as consumers the low trust service this is a bitcoin service delivered in a low trust manner where the bitcoin user need only utilize software they run and control for the services and can protect themselves from malicious third parties with very little trust or consequence from peers this is the gold standard of bitcoin service examples include lightning routing lightning liquidity marketplaces like pool coinjoins like joinmarket coinswaps submarine swaps like loop and others when at all possible this is the kind of service you want to run many services and contracts in bitcoin or layers will claim to be low trust even decentralized which isnt all necessary for a business they are supposed to be centralized but very few are ask yourself what recourse you alone have against fraud and what fraud would be possible for example in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by watching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transactions you can broadcast at will you have responsibility watch the blockchain and recourse publish transactions proving fraud and claim balance the risks revolve around your own capacity time delays locking up your coins and other general inconveniences not impacting your custody trust the service will be provided this is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and have little to no recourse if the service is not provided pretty normal youre risking whatever youre spending in a transaction examples include every merchant business accepting bitcoin the merchants using btcpay server and noncustodial exchanges like bullbitcoin this is also a very good model with limited risk but often little recourse the federated trust service this is a bitcoin service which spreads responsibility across a number of actors for success or failure its not nearly as good as trusting yourself and relies on third parties to protect your interests examples include liquid rsk peg multisig custodians bisq escrow these services often delve into shitcoins and when they do should be avoided like any other the risk in these cases is often not exceptionally limited include custody and your recourse relies on third parties if any exists at all the first party custodian this bitcoin service relies on only itself it often prides itself on this self reliance boasting a lack of third parties and self custody river financial is a good example if you can trust the one business these can be quality services they can also be horrible rug pulling scams the risks in these custodians are similar to a federated service but only trusting one party as with all custodians at and below this point the correct answer is dont use a custodian the rd party custodian this is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian like prime trust examples include strike and swan among many others while both are bitcoin only companies the custodian they rely on holds over shitcoins these kinds of services can be dangerous because they can appear to be very bold bitcoin only companies but on closer inspection you will find they dont self custody a central tenant of a good bitcoin participant in the space user and business alike this can expose users to all kinds of risks and broadens the number of actors exposing users to risk even if its not just custody for example kraken just leaked user data via a zendesk leak this is why evaluating who you are trusting is important and i make these specific examples to illustrate why you cant take even well respected community members at their word you need to evaluate for yourself are you trusting them or a tower of service providers other examples on the more severely negative end of this description include lending platforms like blockfi and celcius where the tower of third party dependency extends through custodianship and lending and other abusive business models these businesses can run the gamut from moderately acceptable to horrible run for your life depending largely on the complexity of the tower of rd party dependency and the severity of risk each party exposes you to the shitcoin casino this isnt a bitcoin service at all its a public harm these are exchanges which service and host scams exposing their users to the custodial risks of their shittiest shitcoin they often print their own shitcoins they lure users in with toogoodtobetrue fees they should be avoided at all cost examples include ftx coinbase binance kraken gemini kucoin and many many others most others i wont be linking them because you shouldnt use them tldr as you evaluate what kind of businesses and services you want to use what risks youre willing to expose yourself and your coins to and hopefully even what kind of businesses you want to encourage in this space consider all your options not every service has made the same trade offs or requires the same trust consider minimizing your exposure to this contagion and not only get off exchanges and custodial services but reevaluate the services were doing business with in the first place avoid shitcoin custodians and services use lower trust solutions lets do more diligence on who we are trusting and how,9,7

2022-12-11 20:10:53,Reddit,bitcoin is a social construct not crypto since bitcoin had a price people have tried to recreate it but with twists like the owner of this one gets a huge chunk of supply then supply gets released when mining or this one has this cool development team or technology behind it therefore better than bitcoin these recreations all focused on the idea of bitcoin as a technology when in fact even the technology used to run bitcoin is subject to change at the whims of social consensus take robux for a minute robux is a popular digital asset issued by the robux corporation it has exchanges though mostly underground for fear of reprisal from the robux corporation what is the functional difference between robux using an sql database between their servers and robux using a private blockchain where only robux servers can create the proofs of work for transfer its still permissioned robux still has full say over whether transfers even happen between accounts and robux is still sold by the robux corporation crypto is much more akin to robux in this way crypto is not subject to the whims of its userbase it is only subject to the corporation behind it bitcoin does not work in this way bitcoin is a social construct the bitcoin core devs have done a pretty good job at making sure nothing that would upset the people who run the software gets through but what would happen if they did new rule block sizes will now be gb instead of mb the first problem theyd run into is that the new software is not compatible with the software everyone else is running people who run the software would be pretty upset at hard drive space filling up rapidly and fork the project into a new repository you now have two chains but which chain is bitcoin so thats what i mean when i say bitcoin is a social construct any argument youd make over which gets to be bitcoin is you enforcing that social construct the current construct around what is bitcoin is that the chain that is compatible with the older software gets to be bitcoin xb wait but the original bitcoin github repo gets to be bitcoin i hear you scream so lets talk about the next problem the original repo would encounter from ignoring the people who run bitcoin when you use a bitcoin wallet and you dont run your own node you use the node that software wallet defaults to now maybe that software wallet enforces the idea that bitcoin is the core repo but it could just as well decide to enforce the social construct that bitcoin is whatever is compatible with an older version of the software in fact it probably would do this by default via not noticing that a new client was even released i mean i cant help but notice that this very sub has a link to download version of core even though version was released miners and price i cant talk about the role that miners would play into this without also including how the price of each chain would effect the miners if users prefer to use one chain over the other its price will go up which makes miners want to mine that chain instead of the other one this means the chain that goes against the users wishes is vulnerable to the hashpower of the chain that supports user decisions being part of the dominant monetary network has its perks xb the dominant monetary network is evidence of the strength of the social construct at hand right now the strongest social construct for money is that government issued paper is money bitcoin is here to challenge that social construct with its own,4,4

2022-12-11 17:13:06,Reddit,lntip this post is for those who have been tipped maybe the tipper linked this post to help you or you want to learn more about lntips on the bitcoin sub rlntipbot for more official information non wallet use you can start right now without set up you just need someone to tip you i recently discovered there is a tip bot that you can use in the bitcoin sub and i think others the great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning wallet and then withdraw your tips or use your own lightning wallet to add sats to your personal tip jar you dont need to if someone tips you sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in sats to it thats the minimum tip then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else no need to even set up a wallet you can use sats all you want just from your own tips get them and pass them on side note you can send private messages to the bot and it will give your balance or a code to send sats to or receive sats via lightning wallet just using the links on the bot reply to tip type lntip or any number higher than it will tip the person you are replying to if you dont have the funds available in your account for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning wallet use with a wallet setting up a lightning wallet and adding sats to the bot a great guide from doublelr tip him if he posts in comments i use muun too so you are in luck it works a very small bit different than you think i am on a phone so this is what i just did to transfer sat from the tipbot balance to my muun wallet very easy youll see prior to doing this you must have the wallet fully set up get your seed phrase words aka your keys and write them down and keep them safe then do the rescueemergency pdf thing too its pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out after that open muun and select receive at the top there are two option buttons select lightning and the screen will change to a lightning address at the bottom you will see invoice settings select that and you will see a button to add an amount and an expiry time for the invoice press add and enter the amount you want to withdraw from the tipbot balance press confirm and the invoice will change again to the address that represents what you just created an invoice for the amount of sats you entered press copy and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your phone open reddit and find a tipbot message it has the blue links in it you see it every time a tip is given press withdraw and it will create the dm format for you once you learn the format very simple you can create it from scratch like a normal dm but the blue link does this for you until you learn the format well enough to create it on your own on the dm page created by the blue link there is a spot that says put_invoice_here delete only that simple phrase and then paste in to the same spot and your invoice you copied earlier will appear the line that says withdraw needs to stay where it is press send open muun as fast as you can and see if you can beat the withdrawal to your wallet from reddit enjoy fellow redditor it seems like a lot but im reality steps will become step for you and steps will also become one step for you so once you learn it its basically two steps lightning is badass enjoy fellow redditor general help some useful faq type information not included on the bot website if you are clueless then hopefully this list will give you enough information to start to google the gaps in your knowledge what is bitcoin its a digital commodity like gold but much easier to transport what are sats each bitcoin is made of a million sats like dollars and cents but with lots more sats per bitcoin to make payments easier what is lightning the bitcoin nextwork is slow and super secure great for transfer of large amounts of money but not good for tips and coffee so clever people built a second layer on top and that is the lighting network it allows you to send sats super fast and cheap what is a bot an automated service to help you dont worry about sending messages to it as long as you dont change the words its just like sending a command to a computer and it will return your answer privately do i need a wallet perhaps not you can be given tips and then check your balance here on reddit and only tip others using your tips a great little circular community but then i do need a wallet yes when you either have so many tips on your reddit ln bot account wallet that you want to withdraw them fully or use them in the real world then you will need a wallet or if you have no tips and want to tip then you will need a wallet whats a reddit ln bot account wallet the clever people who made this tip bot made it so you automatically get a little wallet just for use with the bot only attached to your username that the bot can use to track your tips and balances smart whats a lightning wallet a lightning wallet probably an app that you can install the app allows transfer of bitcoinsats to any other wallets great for buying stuff in locations that accept bitcoin sending bitcoin or sats to your friends l and for sending sats to fill your tip account where do i get a lightning wallet when youre ready to use one google it and find one you like anything else to know only one last bit if you tip more than you have availabille or you try to make a deposit clicking and sending deposit as a message to the bot then the clever bot will give you a long number code that you can copy and enter into your lightning wallet app to make a payment when you do you will have used bitcoin and passed a tip to someone else how nice of you the code side of ln bot heres the github for the lntip bot more really important stuff if you post in a comment and its useful ill copy into here as an edit,56,82

2022-12-10 18:22:43,Reddit,key exfiltration how a signing device could leak a private key blockstream published an article about how a signing device might leak users private keys the premise of this attack is straightforward a hardware wallet can leak the users secret key by carefully constructing its signatures since the compromise happens during signature generation rather than key generation even if the user verifies that her keys were produced from strong randomness eg by generating her seed words by rolling dice and then importing them into multiple wallets to ensure they produce the same addresses it is still possible to execute the attack the solution blockstream is proposing to this isnt quite right though it involves trust in the manufacturer and trust in the software if that software is closed source the solution to this is much more obvious than this novel attempt to secure against it the solution is opensource software that is easy to compile and flash onto the device and opensource hardware that is easy to verify via a visual inspection against a reference like i said in a comment to a post before im not going to talk about particular exploits because i believe defending against the hacker methodology itself is the best thing users can do especially when exploits are known to attackers but not to defenders dont let this scare you away from using bitcoin just get better at your own pace keep your stack at the size you know how to defend a larger stack has justifies a more paranoid threat model,9,9

2022-12-09 00:52:56,Reddit,the lightning network is fast but it kinda sucks i ran my own lightning node for over year so i have so personal experience with it and the model works is its simplicity but i strongly believe that it sucks the entire channel system sucks the main reason is how shit is it to actually have a node to spend unless you have a ton of sats to create a big channel to a place you will use frequently you are gonna end up needing to reopen channels all the time and wont be any better off than using on chain this leads to the use of services like loop and those are both expensive and risky if you look at the trend too centralization in lightning is overt where big nodes grow bigger over time because they provide the least amount of jumps and the most usefulness for most spend user i honestly dont think the channel model is going to survive contact with hyperbitcoinization edit i dont think some of you are getting my point scenario you get paid now you need to pay the bills if you want to do this via ln you have to open a channel to your energy supplier for instance unless you have sats to open a channel worth multiple months of that bill it wont be any cheaper or faster than using onchain and who is gonna have that multiple months of bills to put up front sure if you want to budget a m sats channel for starbucks that could work for a while bur essentially ln forces you to prepay everything the solution for this is hiding all of this from the end user like muun or phoenix does but you are then centralising the services and if you are doing that there are better theoretical solutions edit this is a legit gripe i have but the posting and phrasing was made volatile on purpose to see if it would survive being in the sub inspired by the bitcoin sucks post about this being an echo chamber well guess we are not as this is not downvoted to hell and people are actually engaging in debate,123,133

2022-12-08 21:12:13,Reddit,catalysts for bitcoin so from what ive gathered theres multiple catalysts for bitcoin price next year despite a looming recessionwhich is a fact at this point first one is the halveningobvious by the end of there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long upward trend towards a minimum of k per bitcoin according to models that have a historical price accuracy of bitcoins value should peak at around m per bitcoin in average recession lasts for around months so by the time this one will be over bitcoins price should be around k at the end of next yearbeginning of second one is the gaapaccounting standard next year this law will be improved so that companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value currently if the price goes down in value but jumps back up again companies have to write down the value of the digital asset and cant mark it up starting from next year it will be different which apparently has been a dealbreaker for institutional investors in the past third one is the capital inflow of traditional investors like investment banks pension funds central banks smallbig countries and different funds currently holding digital assets in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulationtransparencypublic disclosings from the beginning of next yearjanuary the united states congress will be having a session where the sec and congress will both fight over which entity gets to set the rules they both seem to be in a hurry to be the first ones which is a positive for crypto investors as the institutions feel safer to invest the capital inflow should be somewhere around trillion usd for the price to reach k at the end of next year current price would have to quadruple so approximately trillion usd would be sufficient total amount of assets held by mutual funds in the us is trillion usd germany has trillion and uk brazil and switzerland collectively own trillion usd thats close to trillion if of this would go to bitcoin its price would quadruple another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effectx of investing in the stock market in which only billion of capital inflow from institutional investors would be necessary to reach a trillion market cap x billion usd trillion i included switzerland because its central bank has said its interested in acquiring bitcoin theres a few other potential catalysts in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positive in the coming year big countries like iranrussia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and the pilot of cbdcs also ukraine is one of the largest bitcoin holders so there are multiple concrete things to look forward to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession the biggest factors for a long bear phase are imo rising oil prices and interest rates until the end of next year in addition to that revolving and nonrevolving credits are at an all time high while the savings rate of americans is at an all time low if the recession will last around months it should be a relatively sound timing for the price to shoot up to k per bitcoin during the third picture is metcalfs law which predicts the value to be minimum k by its not as delicious as the other two models but still decent considering the fact that it would be the minimum value according to this model the value would be minimum m usd during and hover above m until it reaches during next decade these are just some thoughts things ive gathered hope someone finds it useful cheers,1,48

2022-12-08 15:12:30,Reddit,everyone responsible for the confusion between bitcoin and crypto should read this bitcoin ekasi is a bitcoin circular economy in south africa it is one of dozens of bitcoin circular economies around the world inspiring grassroots activities driving the adoption of bitcoin in asia africa latin america the success of bitcoin ekasi is directly responsible for south africas largest supermarket chain pick n pay integrating bitcoin payments throughout the country this is a tweet from bitcoin ekasi today xb heres the reality today i attended the opening of a new bitcoin education center in kumasi ghana in rural africa the village chief spoke during the formalities and he expressed some unexpected skepticism towards the opening of the new center he said and im paraphrasing bitcoin can be good but it can be dangerous bitcoin can be a scam a business collapsed and people lost millions of dollars i am not sure you should teach our children about bitcoin here of course the basics of bitcoin to be taught at this center has nothing to do with the ftx casino and its crypto delinquency but this is the reality of its after effects this is the unseen and largely unrecognized effect of endless tokens riding on bitcoins coattails i challenge anyone who argues against bitcoin maximalism to step outside their techno bubble step outside that place where a small minority of earths people live with a skill that takes years to acquire under the best of circumstances which enables nuanced differentiation take a trip down to ground level come see whats being built and spend time to understand it and then tell me bitcoin maximalism doesnt make sense i am waiting xb the proliferation of endless centralized premine ico shitcoins printed out of thin air by silicon valley start ups hiding behind bitcoin to escape from silicon valley regulations and those who support and enable shitcoin casinos are contributing to the confusion the normalizing of affinity scam marketing and exploitation by companies and vc behind shitcoins is a scourge on bitcoin theres no company behind bitcoin no foundation premine ico vc license trademarks not even an official website code repo or even a formal specification there are only bitcoiners if you think bitcoiners who call out and fight back against marketing of scams in the name of bitcoin are toxic ask yourself what does that say about you when you think about bitcoin think about this message from hal finney the computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people rather than to control them unlike the world of today where people are more or less at the mercy of credit agencies large corporations and governments naturally in todays society with power allocated so disproportionately such ideas are a threat to large organizations balancing power would mean a net loss of power for them so no institution is going to pick up and champion these ideas its going to have to be a grassroots activity one in which individuals first learn of how much power they can have and then demand it hal finney the cypherpunks mailing list bitcoin is a human project built and shaped by people like you and me bitcoins success originates from grassroots activities like bitcoin ekasi empowering people and communities who never had access to the global economy until now even if you are not someone who is positively making a difference to bitcoin at least you can try not to be disruptive to people who are the real heroes of this movement,72,29

2022-12-19 06:35:23,Reddit,comment click here to listen to a few minutes of bitcoin developer jimmy song talk about ethereum and vitalik jimmy worked directly with vitalik from the beginning back when vitalik was still working on rootstock for bitcoin ethereum is a centralized scam that totally revolutionized scams and is the future of pyramid schemes how many erc pyramid scamcoins run on top of ethereum again but it would still be a centralized scam even if it was created without the massive premine ethereum started with a million eth premine but that doesnt mean people cant make money with it a lot of people even made money with bitconnect dogecoin and shiba inu lol so as long as suckers keep buying it then it can keep going up institutional investors have no interest in it and this report details why it even explains that when the fees get too high and things dont go as planned users will and are switch to a different cryptocurrency you can already see this happening right now with all of the eth killers over of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over of them have no future none of them are as secure as decentralized or launched as fairly as bitcoin satoshi created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else bitcoin had no premine no developer fund no developer tax and no leader satoshi never sold made no profit got no fame for his real identity removed himself from the project and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched bitcoin bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol and it has no leader or company leading it cryptocurrency is full of scammersgrifters ignorance and people that actually believe the lies because theyve been sucked into shitcoin cults people use altcoins for tradinggambling to increase their bitcoin stack or even their ethereum stack if they dont understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose bitcoin when gambling on altcoins satoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that bitcoin was launched fairly no premine satoshi didnt grant himself any coins gave a month heads up before launching the network no sudden release and no mining before release coins had no value for years so they circulated freely its not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this satoshi never cashed out unlike every altcoin founder in history and i bet it stays that way for eternity ethereum launched with million eth for the developers and million eth for sale as an initial coin offering they purposely misled investors by suggesting merely million gifted premine and ignoring the million that they sold misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus this is a serious concern in light of ripple getting sued by the sec as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after ethereum developers and the ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security because thats what it is according to the howey test just a few days ago the chair of the sec gary gensler even said that several cryptocurrencies are actually noncompliant seucurities and ethereum is one the two cryptocurrencies that the sec is first focusing on even though etherians always say that the sec said its not a security but theyve really already disregarded that previous claim made by bill hinman former director of the secs division of corporation finance who suggested that offers and sales of eth are not securities transactions gary gensler the current chair of the sec has now said that a lot of crypto tokens i wont call them cryptocurrencies for this moment are indeed noncompliant securities vitalik and many others in the ethereum space are known scammers vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of eth now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but rich statefulness gregory maxwell vitalik buterin ran a quantum computer scam quantum computing and bitcoin with vitalik buterin vitaliks quantum scam the ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots trying to find narrative fit and the ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit theyve literally tried world computer dapps crowdfunding nfts defi open finance radical markets store of value and more ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency but there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution what purpose does ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems they also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks unlike ethereum bitcoins inflation distribution rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change the inflation distribution rate and final algo of ethereum is not even defined and people are investing in this this is insane and it basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team while at the same time newbies are misled into believing that ethereum is decentralized meanwhile vitalik has full control over the whole project do you even remember the dao contract someone found a way to drain eth and some of vitaliks buddies lost a ton of eth so he rolled back the entire blockchain because ethereum is centralized vitalik is the leader of it and everyone in the ethereum community agrees with him and he can do whatever he wants he chose to change the name of the real ethereum blockchain to ethereum classic and calls his rolled back blockchain ethereum not long ago eth miners said they werent going to follow vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn so vitalik leader of ethereum called their consensus a attack and changed the rules vitalik can only control ethereum because its centralized the fact that ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your eth being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations exchanges for example must send a misc to the irs on behalf of any american user earning in a year proofofstake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and i have no expectation that the new ethereum will be any more successful than the current one this can only be done because ethereum is centralized ethereum will still be a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers vitalik is already laying the groundwork for some more hype and suggesting a rebrand to ethereum ethereum scam part here we focus on the ethereum token presale which to anyone with any financial experience is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security ethereum scam part here we take a look at the value business proposition of decentralized smart contracts and why its one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient ethereum scam part the ethereum scam part ethereum and ethereum classic are scams and so are the developers that build on them addendum here is is an actual clip of joseph lubin describing how they allowed whales to use multiple fake identities to buy as much eth as they wanted during the ethereum presale a person can buy with any number of different identities we may limit the unit size of a single sale to make it easier to disguise so that nobody scares people with an enormous initial purchase if you are a whale and you plan on investing several million us dollars worth then you can do so with with multiple identities joseph lubin is the founder and ceo of consensys and a cofounder of ethereum the goal is to lure people in and switch to proof of stake and rule,1,0

2022-12-19 04:30:04,Reddit,comment coinbase has insurance limited to losses caused by external malicious actors theft by hacking im reminded of the data loss clause in my old business insurance policy the coverage was conditional on the business having robust backup and recovery processes and it only covered the cost of recovery not consequential losses i figured that if i have robust backup and recovery processes and inhouse skills for recovery the inhouse cost is too small to be worth insuring a case where the policy conditions created a selfinsurance situation if an insurer applied the same principles to an exchange then the exchange would need to acquire the technical skills and implement processes which prevent lost keys accidents then the accidents would happen so rarely that the insurance is nothing more than an extreme backstop an exchange might still try to get away with cutting costs by not implementing the appropriate processes an accident happens the insurer should refuse the claim and a dispute would spend years in the legal system in principle similar conditions can be applied to selfcustody of bitcoin with losses covered by home contents insurance the claim limits might be only a few thousand dollars worth less than the my life savings in bitcoin assumptions in the op,1,0

2022-12-19 03:38:00,Reddit,comment thats what i thought you meant my belief is that investment is not incentivized by the devaluing of the currency investment occurs because people want more in the future than they have now and they are willing to delay the purchasing of goods to increase their future purchasing power if everyone is holding the hard money that is increasing in usd terms at a year your purchasing power is not going up by there is the same amount of beach front real estate available for purchase so your actual increase in purchasing power will be derived from your returns in excess of the currency value increase that everyone experienced so investment will still be worth while way of increasing purchasing power it just wont be a necessity to avoid the money you are paid from your job becoming worthless over time thats why i said it will improve the economy over time as it becomes harder for organizations to raise capital they will have to become better and better to attract investment thus resulting in better products and services for the people while the medium of exchange is holding value through time and the greatest benefit of all the government can no longer slowly steal money out of the people at a rate target,2,0

2022-12-19 03:11:26,Reddit,comment yeah my point is when the medium of exchange can be manipulated then whatever investment no matter the diversity is still at risk of being devalued im not going to convince you or change your mind here with these comments but please take some time to look into austrian economics if you arent familiar saifedeen ammous is a good start imo for explaining the austrian perspective on finance his podcast the bitcoin standard podcast is a really good listen and hes got two books the bitcoin standard and the fiat standard that are also great starting points i will say i dont understand your point about how diversifying a portfolio carrying so much risk compared to the near risk free rate of hodling btc i see more actors withdrawing and holding which will further a deflationary spiral until it is clear hodling is the choice and the economy tanks are you agreeing that as the fiat system collapses more and more people will simply buy and hold bitcoin as its the hardest money available holding will increase and the economy tanks i dont understand the logic do you mean that everyone will only hold bitcoin and not the other assets and because of that the economy will tank eventually those assets that have been inflated in price by the infinite money printing will crash so severe that even bitcoin maximalist would be enticed by the possible returns but now instead of being forced to invest their melting ice cube of dollars they will be more thoughtful with their investments as they have the option to increasing purchasing power simply by holding the unit of exchange this will be healthier for the economy as investing in capital markets becomes less of a necessity and goes back to being actual acts of speculation this will weed out the lower tier organizations that exist today only because long term interest rates are effectively zero and cash is worthless over time edit brainwashed may be a stretch but it does seem like you are pretty indoctrinated in the investment finance or the keynesian way of economics you seem like an intelligent person who could find some benefit or truth from the other point of view edit edit i also have a finance degree yours is probably better but i am familiar with the traditional perspective on how the economy functions,2,0

2022-12-19 02:52:50,Reddit,comment yes and no but mostly no all such loans would be unsecured loans so lenders would take on massive risks as most startups would default on their loans most startups fail in the first year with fiat banks actually print the money they lend out common misconception of fractional reserve banking is that banks lend out customer funds an entirely different risk model in case of default especially as most of that is insured and inflation is on their side you wouldnt be able to build the same extensive lending or insurance markets under a bitcoin standard insurance is also a different behemoth sure taxes would be paid in btc to the govt and the govt could provide insurance for lenders but why would it when most loans would be defaulted on who else would insure it remember you will have a deflationary currency assuming keys continue to be lost and the assumption of increasing value is not a solution when you need to deal with volatility you also shouldnt be surprised at most of the replies in here which seem to boil down to save and you should not need a loan,2,0

2022-12-19 02:46:14,Reddit,comment this is a relatively new thing in the us there was a settlement a few years ago between a bunch of highprofile retailers with significant cash business and visa and american express if i recall correctly where in the agreements with the processors and banks prohibited vendors from charging two different prices for cash and credit that prohibition is what had so many vendors institute a handwritten notice at checkout with a or minimum that settlement or court decision cant remember which declared that prohibition on two different prices to be an illegal part of the contract so retailers and restaurants and whatnot were allowed to start charging different prices or add on a credit card service fee in order to cover any transaction fees where i live i havent seen these fees being added just quite yet ive seen them a little bit in my travels im still using credit cards because the fee is generally less than what im getting back in cash back plus having all of my transactions in one place makes accounting easier and the guarantees of the credit card are worth the little bit extra i strongly advise people never to use debit cards for anything other than atm withdrawal because they generally lack the fraud protections that credit cards have i predict that credit card users will be paying fees far more often within the next two to three years as processing contracts come up for renewal i wouldnt be surprised if those fees end up getting waived with some kind of a yearly or monthly membership payment to the issuer until i can use bitcoin or other crypto at my coffee shop my grocery store and the other necessities i will always use a credit card over debit or cash i did the onlycash thing for the first approximately years of my adult life and ill never go back to that,2,0

2022-12-19 02:34:25,Reddit,comment im unsure what youre getting at i agree there is no risk free store of capital as any system can fail im saying that in a deflationary state that the purchasing power of the capital will be greater in the future than at the current moment this leads to less incentive to invest now and to do so further into the future because to invest now would be to risk not getting all or any capital back which is inherently less valuable than nearly guaranteed more value in the future during long periods of deflation actors in the market are increasingly more prone to delaying investments in the real world this causes the economy to spiral downwards as businesses no longer pursue investments and rather hold capital inflation sucks at large amounts but inflation is a positive thing and a currency should utilize inflation to incentivize actors in the market to invest and compete,1,0

2022-12-19 02:09:24,Reddit,comment i do not want more fees for consumers i want consumers to pay for the goods and services that they use a shift in payment method needs to be voluntary on the part of the consumers not forced on them by merchants consumers use credit cards now despite it being a raw deal for merchants because it is easy and convient bitcoin is a superior payment method compared to credit cards in terms of fees and settlement time but consumers do not care how quickly a merchant is paid and the price signal is removed from the consumer if they do not have to pay it the cost is instead absorbed into the business and factored into all of the prices card payment are not great for merchants they are literally paying for money to be transfered from the customer to themselves on top of the high fees they wont see the money for weeks or months a big deal at small and family owned businesses and both legitimate and fraudulent backcharges cut into their margins even more remember visa has little incentive to reject backcharges because they work for the consumers not the merchants fraudulent backcharges are a larger issue for merchants than people realize and even in the event of a legitimate chargeback someones card was stolen the merchant still provided a good or service to the thief in essence a consumer was robbed and visa shifted that thief onto merchants and other businesses imagine checking out at a store and saying hey i dont have any cash on me right now im going to mail it to you when i get home could you give me some stamps to pay for it it will be here next week i believe that if a candy bar costs the seller should have in their hand when i leave the store with a candy bar this is possible with cash and with bitcoin with a credit card they get a promise of cents that may or may not arrive in a few weeks i think that the very least the consumer can do in exchange for having the winning side of the trade is pay the processing fee this added cost will not only force visa to return to more reasonable fees now but it will also but them direct competition with bitcoin or the lightning network if a store were to accept both forms of payment edit grammar and spelling,1,0

2022-12-19 01:26:32,Reddit,comment ive been on a long bitcoincrypto learning journey i even work for a crypto company my conclusion when factoring in where we are within the larger financial macro climate is this bitcoin is a niche its a token for those that believe in being able to disconnect and opt out of the central governmental system its a great way to hide wealth from significant others in the case of divorces you can say you lost your seed phrase too awesome of course your address if known could be monitored to see if you move your bitcoin but thats unlikely for most small net worth divorces you can send money around the world super easy move money across boarders super easy with bitcoin all good however we all live on land in countries and towns and cities that are all operating within the rule and law of central governmental systems in your average day of living in a home commuting to work buying groceries using utilities earning a wage paying tax you are not able to opt out the system the only way would be to buy some remote island and survive all by yourself ed stafford style to get bitcoins the majority of us exchange our fiat to use bitcoins in most of every day life scenarios we have to exchange back to fiat so then its a inflation hedge but its ability to beat inflation is based solely on the price that people are exchanging it to fiat for so then it starts to enter ponzi territory in that you hope the person after you bought it is going to pay more for it when you sell it i dont see how and why central governments would hand over control to a trustless currency to peg their too no government would hand over such control so i just dont see it going to mass adoption or m value per coin territory i see it just being a niche like esperanto language and thats not because im against it i was paid in bitcoin for awhile it would be awesome if we got to m per coin but i just dont see it limited supply people like saylor and other whales gobbling it up manipulating it etc why would you want something of limited supply that some guy over there has absolutely loads of it lets see if you have spare cash and absolutely zero idea what to do with it and have a cold wallet etc ok but as with ftx for the average person which exchange you gonna trust the on ramps now all look like scams and the whole uiux of wallets and addresses its kinda techy you need to be computer literate and those long addresses i double check it multiple times but such a pain and any error as many have found and your moneys gone sent to wrong address etc so for mass adoption its just been set back massively and still isnt as easy to use as an apple pay like product and pretty much every other crypto after bitcoin is absolutely hot air scam based on absolutely nothing just printed out of thin air nonsense would not touch any of it pure speculation at the mercy of those that created the tokens,4,0

2022-12-19 00:37:47,Reddit,comment i agree that some merchants can choose to offer cash discounts and then implement alternative payment flows in their pos systems to adjust for cash cheque debit card or credit card fees but these are complex formulae even with cc you have many different fee structures depending on the item purchased and the type of cardinterchangeprocessor used so i would argue that the thing preventing merchants from offering varied discounts is the hassle in implementing all the multitiered pricing systems for the same inventory with credit cards growing more and more popular the typical merchant doesnt have much of a choice but to pay a processing fee to the card issuer and payment processor by knowing how much the merchant will pay on each average transaction the merchant can price their inventory of products appropriately and ensure for making enough money on each sale the additional complexity and costs to retool a pos to handle the varied fee structures is just too difficult so many merchants will just have one price for each inventory i guess it should be obvious that to propose that a business just opt for cashonly and not do credit cards is to propose they go down the path to bankruptcy,1,0

2022-12-19 00:19:52,Reddit,comment i could not agree with you more on restaurant tipping it is disgusting that us businesses get away underpaying their workers and passing that cost on to the consumer the key difference here is that you dont have the option of walking into the kitchen and getting your own food at most restaurants the waiters are necessary and integral parts of the dining experience credit card fees are not the same they are not required to operate a business they are a convenience service for the customers not the business i dont see why you would call this greed when you grab a pack of gum at the grocery store they charge you for this not because of greed but because that pack of gum cost the store money just like using a credit card would grocery stores on average make less than cents on the dollar which with credit card fees means visa is making more money when you check out than the store which actually provided you with products with service stores already do fact credit card processing fees into their prices its the only way they can afford it charging cash customers extra to pay for credit card users also isnt a fair mechanic and who wins if they stop accepting cards now nobody with a credit card only is able to shop there at all talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face im curious where you would draw the line if credit cards costs of the purchase amount to process obviously they would not price that into the prices businesses would need to charge buyers for this service as a result significant numbers of people would likely start using cash but there would be some percentage of people who still pay the fee in exchange for the convenience of not paying in cash luckily credit cards do not cost this much but at the end of the day it is a product for the consumer not the merchant,1,0
